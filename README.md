# CouchDB

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/couchdb-rs/couchdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/couchdb-rs/couchdb)

---

**This project is deprecated.** A new crate, [Chill][chill-rs], is the
way forward and will provide a safer and more useful abstraction, as
well as eliminating some inefficiencies. You can read a little bit about
the rationale [here][rethinking_couchdb_in_rust].

At the time of writing this (2016-03-26), Chill has minimal coverage of
the CouchDB API. I expect Chill to catch up to and surpass this crate in
coverage by late spring of 2016.

This project provides a CouchDB client-side library for the Rust
programming language.

The library provides low-level access to individual HTTP actionsâ€”e.g.,
PUT database, GET document, etc. It handles the menial task of sending
requests and receiving responses, thereby allowing application
programmers to focus on their business logic.
