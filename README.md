# CouchDB

CouchDB client library for the Rust programming language.

## Overview

The couchdb library is a thin wrapper around the CouchDB API. It
provides low-level access to individual HTTP actions—e.g., PUT database,
GET document, etc.—thereby handling the menial task of sending requests
and receiving responses and allowing application programmers to focus on
their business logic.
