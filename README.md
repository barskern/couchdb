# CouchDB
A simple CouchDB client for the Rust programming language

Documentation: https://couchdb-rs.github.io/couchdb/doc/latest/couchdb/

This crate is young and lacks many features from the CouchDB APIâ€”e.g.,
attachments, shows, meta-information for databases and documents, etc. I
intend to add these features eventually. Meanwhile, if you want to see
any specific features added right away, please submit an issue or pull
request. Let's make this crate better.
