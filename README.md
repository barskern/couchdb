# CouchDB
A simple CouchDB client for the Rust programming language

Documentation: https://couchdb-rs.github.io/couchdb/doc/latest/couchdb/

This crate lacks many features from the CouchDB APIâ€”e.g., attachments,
shows, meta-information for databases and documents, etc. I intend to
add these features eventually. Meanwhile, if you want any features added
right away, please submit an issue or pull request. Let's make this
crate better.
