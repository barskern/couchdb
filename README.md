# CouchDB

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/couchdb-rs/couchdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/couchdb-rs/couchdb)

This project comprises a CouchDB client library for the Rust programming
language.

The couchdb library provides low-level access to individual HTTP
actionsâ€”e.g., PUT database, GET document, etc. It handles the menial
task of sending requests and receiving responses, thereby allowing
application programmers to focus on their business logic.
